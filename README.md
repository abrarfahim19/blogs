# blogs
blogs to be extracted by api and shown in my blog post. Primary intention is to have markdown file that will convert into blog post. And then later use previously built ipnyb file extraction model into it.
## This repo is discontinued. As it has been implemented in other [Repo](https://github.com/abrarfahim19/EIDNEXT23) and hosted @ [my-site](https://abrarfahim.me).
